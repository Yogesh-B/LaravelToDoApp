## points for practice
1. backend Laravel with Auth
2. frontend Nuxt
3. DB mysql
4. nginx 
5. **most important** DOCKERIZE ALL THOSE STUFF!! I WANT A SIGNLE COMMAND TO RUN ALL AT ONCE.(fast startup and graceful shutdownðŸ¤©)
6. setup github actions
7. okteto can be used to deploy the thing.


## Extra stuff
1. Make it as complex as you can! with only one purpose... learning!!! do not care about usecase!
  - like we can add chat feature, community features like sharing, followers, likes(kind of notes facebook)
