# LaravelToDoApp
Just revising Laravel and Nuxt skills, and also learning docker.


## points for practice
1. backend Laravel
2. frontend Nuxt
3. DB mysql
4. nginx 
5. **most important** DOCKERIZE ALL THOSE STUFF!! I WANT A SIGNLE COMMAND TO RUN ALL AT ONCE.(fast startup and graceful shutdownðŸ¤©)
6. setup github actions
